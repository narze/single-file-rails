# Single File Rails

This is a simple Rails application that only has one file, inspired from [this blog post](https://greg.molnar.io/blog/a-single-file-rails-application). It's a simple way to test out Rails without having to create a bunch of files.
Tested on Ruby 3.3.0

## Requirements

- Bundler `gem install bundler`
- Rack `gem install rack`

## Usage

To run the application, simply run:

```bash
$ rackup app.ru
```

Then visit [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) in your browser.
